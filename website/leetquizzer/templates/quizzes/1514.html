    <h1>Path with Maximum Probability</h1>
    <div class="problem-description">
        <p>
            You are given an undirected weighted graph of n nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where edges[i] = [a, b] is an undirected edge connecting the nodes a and b with a probability of success of traversing that edge succProb[i].
        </p>
        <p>
            Given two nodes start and end, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from start to end and return its success probability.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is no path from start to end, return 0. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most 1e-5.

        <h3>Example 1:</h3>
        <code>
        Input:
        n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2
        Output: 0.25000
        </code>
        <p>Explanation: There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.</p>

        <h3>Example 2:</h3>
        <code>
        Input:
        n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2
        Output: 0.30000

        Output: 0.00000
        Explanation: There is no path between 0 and 2.
