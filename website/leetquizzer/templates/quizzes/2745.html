    <h1>Construct the Longest New String</h1>
    <div class="problem-description">
        <p>
            You are given three integers x, y, and z.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have x strings equal to "AA", y strings equal to "BB", and z strings equal to "AB". You want to choose some (possibly all or none) of these strings and concatenate them in some order to form a new string. This new string must not contain "AAA" or "BBB" as a substring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Return the maximum possible length of the new string.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="code-section">
        <h3>Example 1:</h3>
        <code>
        Input:
        x = 2, y = 5, z = 1
        Output: 12
        </code>
        <p>Explanation: We can concatenate the strings "BB", "AA", "BB", "AA", "BB", and "AB" in that order. Then, our new string is "BBAABBAABBAB". <br>
        That string has length 12, and we can show that it is impossible to construct a string of longer length.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="code-section">
        <h3>Example 2:</h3>
        <code>
        Input:
        x = 3, y = 2, z = 2
        Output: 14
        </code>
        <p>Explanation: We can concatenate the strings "AB", "AB", "AA", "BB", "AA", "BB", and "AA" in that order. Then, our new string is "ABABAABBAABBAA". <br>
        That string has length 14, and we can show that it is impossible to construct a string of longer length.</p>
